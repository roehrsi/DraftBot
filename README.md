# DraftBot
## Hey there!
*honk honk* This is DraftBot. He can help you draft the team of your dream in Heroes of the Storm! Take a minute to read the command doc below to get started.

### !draft
To start a draft, the !draft command will begin a fresh draft for you. Use either the !draft tournament [@Opponent] command if you want to start with flipping a coin for the first pick and drafting a map, or !draft quick [map] [@Opponent] if you want to pick a map directly and move on to the hero draft. Only you and your tagged opponent can influence the draft, so you are safe from griefers and run-downers ;). Nobody can stop you from tagging yourself though...

### !ban
The !ban command is your one stop shop for banning maps and heroes. It takes one argument - the map or hero name - and adds that to the draft.DraftBot can handle some spelling error and shorthands, but try not to be too obscure with your inputs

### !pick
The !pick command works just like !ban for map and hero picks.For the double pick phases, the !pick command also takes two arguments.

### !draft help
Use the !draft help command to display this information.

### drafting order
Order adheres to HotS tournament draft standard with **A** as coin toss winner:
* Map Bans: **B A B A**
* Map Pick: **B**
* Hero Bans: **A B A B**
* Hero Picks: **A BB AA**
* Hero Bans: **B A**
* Hero Picks: **BB AA B**
